# Finereads

## App Description

This is a Goodreads clone created as part of my course at General Assembly. As an avid reader and someone who uses Goodreads a lot, I wanted to see what went into building a similar site. My site allows a user to create an account and keep track of books they would like to read, are reading, and have already read. The site pulls book metadata from Google Books API.

## Next Steps

Future enhancements would include the ability to filter and sort search results, showing more than the first 20 search results with a "next" and "back" button, better formatting of API data, the ability to view different editions of the same book in order to choose which one to shelve, and a more responsive site.
